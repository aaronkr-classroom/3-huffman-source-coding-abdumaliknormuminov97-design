# Huffman Source Coding

Huffman source coding is a lossless data compression method.

## What is Huffman Coding?

Huffman coding assigns shorter binary codes to symbols with higher frequency
and longer codes to symbols with lower frequency.

## Steps of Huffman Coding

1. List all symbols and their frequencies  
2. Combine two symbols with the lowest frequencies  
3. Repeat until only one node remains  
4. Assign binary codes (0 and 1) to each symbol  

## Simple Example

Symbols and frequencies:

- A: 5  
- B: 9  
- C: 12  
- D: 13  

Example Huffman codes:

- A: 110  
- B: 111  
- C: 10  
- D: 0  

## Advantage

Huffman coding reduces the size of data without losing information.

## Conclusion

Huffman source coding is widely used in data compression.
